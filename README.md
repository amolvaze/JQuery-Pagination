# JQuery-Pagination - Superb Project!

JQuery pagination is a hobby project which I have developed to see how pagination works in JQuery using plugins.

A project has basic index.html file with styles.css for styling.

HTML page has some dummy static content taken for the purpose of this project.

HTML page has total 3 JS files which have been included before ending of the body tag  viz: jquery library, custom.js and pagination.js respectively.

custom.js has json object representation inside a function call of custompaginate which is a function we have defined inside paginate.js.
Inside paginate.js we are restricting 5 number of posts per page.

We are doing some kind of animations on body, HTML elements.

Whenever we click on page number at bottom of pagination mechanism, the new set of pages get loaded into DOM.

It looks like every time page is getting refreshed when we cick on new page of the pagination mechanism.

Nice plugin to work with.

Overall enjoyed this project!
